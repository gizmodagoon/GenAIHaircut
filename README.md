# GenAI Haircut Tracker

GenAI Haircut Tracker is a web application that helps clients and barbers track haircut histories, share photos, and receive AI-generated feedback. Clients can upload photos of their haircuts, tag styles and barbers, see trends over time, and share with friends. Barbers can maintain portfolios, get insights on consistency and quality, and build a verified public profile. This project uses React and TypeScript for the web interface, with plans to integrate AI-driven image analysis and recommendations in future phases.
